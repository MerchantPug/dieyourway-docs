# Welcome to the Die Your Way Documentation

Before reading this documentation, please have a decent understanding of Apoli conditions and Minecraft's Raw JSON text format as this has information that builds from there.

You can visit [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/die-your-way) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/die-your-way) to download the Die Your Way mod.

Thank you Apace for making Calio and Apoli which this mod heavily utilises both.

## General Information
* This entire documentation is always accurate to the latest version of Die Your Way.
* Nearly every Apoli condition is included in Die Your Way without Apoli. The exceptions to this are `apoli:exposed_to_sun` and `apoli:in_rain` and any powers that involve Apoli's powers/actions.
