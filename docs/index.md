# Welcome to the DieYourWay Documentation

Before reading this documentation, please have a decent understanding of Apoli conditions and Minecraft's Raw JSON text format as this has information that builds from there.

You can visit [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/die-your-way) or [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/die-your-way) to download the DieYourWay mod.

Thank you Apace for making Calio and Apoli of which this mod heavily utilises both.

## General Information
* This entire documentation is accurate to version 1.1.1 of DieYourWay.
* Nearly every Apoli condition is included in DieYourWay without Apoli. The exceptions to this is anything that involve Apoli's powers/actions.
